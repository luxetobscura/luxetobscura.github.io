**IT is about people, not technology.** Technology defines how people live, work, and play.

**Perception is reality.** Whatever people perceive is real to them.

**Own your mistakes.** Help prevent others from making the same mistakes that you have.

**Maintain your poise.** A situation isn't out of control until you lose control of yourself.

**Talk in a straight line.** Know what your point is before you start talking. Arrive there with the fewest detours possible.

**Tailor your communication.** Know who youâ€™re talking to and what the most important things on their mind are.

**Balance efficiency and tact.** Being concise and being cordial are not mutually exclusive. 

**Seek outcomes.** Think critically about processes and metrics - they exist to help *guide* you to outcomes, but should not be the end-all be-all.
