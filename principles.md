- IT is about people, not computers.
  - Computers exist to facilitate the things that people do.
- Own your mistakes, and help make sure nobody else makes the same mistakes that you have.
  - Not owning your mistakes is a quick path to ostracization.
- Maintain your poise.
  - A situation is never out of control until you lose control of yourself.
- Talk in a straight line.
  - Know what your point is before you start talking. Arrive there with the fewest detours possible.
- Tailor your communication.
  - Know who you’re talking to and what the most important things on their mind are. Nobody likes being told things they don’t care about.
- Tread the line between efficiency and tact with deftness.
  - Whether simple or complex, communicate ideas and issues without coming across as unpleasant.
- Seek outcomes. Think critically about processes and metrics.
  - Processes and metrics exist to help guide you to desired outcomes. Work to improve processes and metrics if they don't make sense.
- Perception is reality.
  - People act on their perception. Whatever they perceive is their reality.
