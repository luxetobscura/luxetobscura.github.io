**IT is about people, not technology.** Technology serves people. Be wary of the inverse.

**Seek outcomes.** Processes and metrics are guidelines, not substitutes, for outcomes.

**Be relentless.** Perfect may be the enemy of good, but mediocre is the enemy of all.

**Optimize your effort.** Just because you spent a lot of effort on something doesn't mean it's good.

**Own your mistakes.** Failure is inevitable. Defeat occurs only when you fail to address your failures.

**Perception is reality.** Whatever people perceive is real to them, for better or worse.

**Maintain your poise.** Lose control of yourself, lose control of the situation.

**Talk in a straight line.** Know what your point is before you start talking. Arrive there with the fewest detours possible.

**Tailor your communication.** Know who youâ€™re talking to and what they care about.

**Balance efficiency and tact.** Being concise and being cordial are not mutually exclusive.
