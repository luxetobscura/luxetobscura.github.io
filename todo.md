## Human stuff (PeopleOps?)

- Solving people problems with technology, the eternal comedy
- Essential guide for the unwilling leader, aka finding the energy to keep caring when nobody else around you does
- Becoming the shot-caller, aka building a technical career by calling people idiots
  - The most important part: you don't actually call them idiots. Only an idiot would do that.
- Enshittification
  - [Pluralistic: Tiktok’s enshittification (21 Jan 2023) – Pluralistic: Daily links from Cory Doctorow](https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys)

  - Learning to learn
    - The cycle: consume, imitate, iterate, extrapolate, create (surely someone else has a more eloquent way to express this)
    - Seeking understanding converges on desired outcomes
    - Seeking outcomes does not necessarily converge on understanding
    - The importance of coaching/mentoring
    - What does "perfect practice makes perfect" actually mean? (Imperfect practice _with instant feedback_ makes perfect practice)
    - Seeking validation without breaking yourself: safe spaces vs. broadcast media
  - Context is literally everything, perception is equivalent to reality, and opinions are more valuable than facts

    - MMORPGs: solution optimization, team building, conflict resolution, crab mentality, dealing with burnout, creating meaningful relationships in transactional frameworks
    - Biochemistry and medicine: learning hard lessons about academia, knowing when something isn't a good fit, breaking out of "packer" mentality (mapping "things" to "systems")
    - Chemical and electrical engineering: breaking into "mapper" mentality, generalizing knowledge, seeking understanding, systems design, safety engineering, scrutinizing heuristics as a substitute for understanding
  - Deduplicating the sum total of human knowledge, aka reducing the signal-to-noise ratio
    - How do you determine the value of information?
