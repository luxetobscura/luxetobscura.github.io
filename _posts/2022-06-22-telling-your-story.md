Humans love a good story. Unfortunately, there are a lot of ways to tell a bad story.

## Narrative shape, or why STAR sucks for spinning yarns

STAR: Situation-Task-Action-Response. A time-tested, albeit formulaic, method of delivering a story. Commonly employed as an interview strategy, it's not unusual to recognize this format in casual conversations either. Best used as a "linter" for your actual story, and not as a template for the story.

People love comeback stories. If you're interviewing for a job, an extremely effective narrative shape is that of a large obstacle. Some people refer to this as the "man-in-a-hole;" others use the mountain analogy. Regardless of your preferred metaphor, the following key elements spin a great yarn:

* Anchor yourself with an outline of your role and responsibilities.
* Establish the challenge. Add some layers to keep things interesting - "dig the hole," so to speak. Set up obstacles (but don't play them just yet) to be knocked down in the turnaround.
* Begin climbing. Tailor your "climb" to highlight traits that you're proud of and that your audience is interested in.
  * In many cases, interviews for technical roles are split into technical and behavioral assessments. If you've passed the technical part, this is your big chance to demonstrate your soft skills by describing your thought process and solutions.
* End on a positive note, but avoid wrapping up with a "happily ever after" ending. The real world is complex and messy - no story has a flawless ending, and failing to address that can make you look oblivious.

Some guidelines that should hopefully be obvious:
* Don't lie. If there's even a soupcon of suspicion, the story falls apart.
* Resist the temptation to tell someone else's story. You won't be able to stand up under closer scrutiny.
* Stay professional. Don't paint others as villains - it reflects poorly on you.
