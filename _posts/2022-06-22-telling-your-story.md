## STAR is a great tool and a garbage template

**People love comeback stories.** If you're interviewing for jobs, an extremely effective narrative shape is that of a large obstacle. Some people refer to this as the "man-in-a-hole" story; others use the "mountain" analogy. However, there is a fairly common pentagram-shaped trap that prospective interviewees often fall into.

**STAR**, or "Situation-Task-Action-Response", is a time-tested, albeit somewhat formulaic, narrative structure. Many interviewees make the mistake of scorching their responses by hugging the STAR framework too closely, resulting in a narrative geography not unlike the surface of Mercury: arid, cratered, and devoid of life.

## Third Rock from the STAR

Regardless of your preferred metaphor for narrative shape, keeping the following key elements in mind can help you create a lush, engaging story:

- **Anchor yourself** with an outline of your organization and role.
  - Who were your superiors, subordinates, and customers?
  - What was *truly unique* about your setting?
- **Establish the challenge** by building tension - "dig the hole," so to speak. Set up obstacles (but don't play them just yet) to be knocked down in the turnaround.
  - What was on the line?
  - What historical events led you to that point in time?
  - Layer the problem to make things more interesting. What complicating factors made potential solutions more difficult?
- **Begin the climb** by describing how you attacked and overcame each obstacle. Tailor your "climb" to highlight personal traits that you're proud of and that your audience is interested in.
  - In many cases, interviews for technical roles are split into technical and behavioral assessments. If you've passed the technical part, this is your big chance to demonstrate your soft skills.
  - Describe your thought process. What guiding principles informed your decisions?
  - Sprinkle in some of those layers. What unexpected challenges did you discover during the climb, and how did you deal with them?
  - How did you win over your superiors, subordinates, and customers? What did you do to alleviate their pain?
- **End on an optimistic note**, but avoid wrapping up with a "happily ever after" ending. The real world is complex and messy - no story has a flawless ending, and failing to address that can make you look oblivious.
  - What were the net positive outcomes?
  - What would you have done differently?
  - Which loose ends were left over that were too difficult to deal with at the time?

Some ethical guidelines that should hopefully be obvious:

- Don't lie. If there's even a *soup√ßon* of suspicion, the story falls apart.
- Resist the temptation to tell someone else's story. You won't be able to withstand closer scrutiny.
- Stay professional. Don't paint others as villains - it reflects poorly on you.

In short, it's best to think of STAR not as a *template*, but as a *linter* for your story. Check that your story addresses the general points of the STAR framework, but sculpt the narrative into a unique tale that only you could tell.
